# Lowtrust document sharing

This project aims at providing a proof-of-concept for an end-to-end encrypted document hosting and sharing platform.

Its goal is to be able to store sensitive documents (identity card, pay slips, ...) and share them only to people the user wants to share it. This could be useful, for example, to automatically declare revenue for taxes.

A core idea is that the backend can't be trusted, and that this project should resist both the backend eavesdropping, and modifying the documents.

This is still a work-in-progres.
